<h2>BY J. F. BONE</h2></div>

<p>&#9632; "We call it Thurston's Disease for
two perfectly good reasons," Dr.
Walter Kramer said. "He discovered
it&mdash;and he was the first to die of it."
The doctor fumbled fruitlessly
through the pockets of his lab coat.
"Now where the devil did I put those
matches?"</p>

<p>"Are these what you're looking
for?" the trim blonde in the gray
seersucker uniform asked. She picked
a small box of wooden safety matches
from the littered lab table beside
her and handed them to him.</p>

<p>"Ah," Kramer said. "Thanks.
Things have a habit of getting lost
around here."</p>

<p>"I can believe that," she said as
she eyed the frenzied disorder around
her. Her boss wasn't much better
than his laboratory, she decided as
she watched him strike a match
against the side of the box and apply
the flame to the charred bowl of his
pipe. His long dark face became half
obscured behind a cloud of bluish
smoke as he puffed furiously. He
looked like a lean untidy devil recently
escaped from hell with his
thick brows, green eyes and lank
black hair highlighted intermittently
by the leaping flame of the match.
He certainly didn't look like a pathologist.
She wondered if she was going
to like working with him, and shook
her head imperceptibly. Possibly, but
not probably. It might be difficult being
cooped up here with him day after
day. Well, she could always quit
if things got too tough. At least there
was that consolation.</p>

<p>He draped his lean body across a
lab stool and leaned his elbows on its
back. There was a faint smile on his
face as he eyed her quizzically.
"You're new," he said. "Not just to
this lab but to the Institute."</p>

<p>She nodded. "I am, but how did
you know?"</p>

<p>"Thurston's Disease. Everyone in
the Institute knows that name for the
plague, but few outsiders do." He
smiled sardonically. "Virus pneumonic
plague&mdash;that's a better term for
public use. After all, what good does
it do to advertise a doctor's stupidity?"</p>

<p>She eyed him curiously. "<i>De mortuis?</i>"
she asked.</p>

<p>He nodded. "That's about it. We
may condemn our own, but we don't
like laymen doing it. And besides,
Thurston had good intentions. He
never dreamed this would happen."</p>

<p>"The road to hell, so I hear, is
paved with good intentions."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," Kramer said dryly.
"Incidentally, did you apply for
this job or were you assigned?"</p>

<p>"I applied."</p>

<p>"Someone should have warned you
I dislike clich&eacute;s," he said. He paused
a moment and eyed her curiously.
"Just why did you apply?" he asked.
"Why are you imprisoning yourself
in a sealed laboratory which you
won't leave as long as you work here.
You know, of course, what the conditions
are. Unless you resign or are
carried out feet first you will remain
here ... have you considered what
such an imprisonment means?"</p>

<p>"I considered it," she said, "and it
doesn't make any difference. I have
no ties outside and I thought I could
help. I've had training. I was a nurse
before I was married."</p>

<p>"Divorced?"</p>

<p>"Widowed."</p>

<p>Kramer nodded. There were plenty
of widows and widowers outside.
Too many. But it wasn't much worse
than in the Institute where, despite
precautions, Thurston's disease took
its toll of life.</p>

<p>"Did they tell you this place is
called the suicide section?" he asked.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Weren't you frightened?"</p>

<p>"Of dying? Hardly. Too many
people are doing it nowadays."</p>

<p>He grimaced, looking more satanic
than ever. "You have a point," he admitted,
"but it isn't a good one.
Young people should be afraid of
dying."</p>

<p>"You're not."</p>

<p>"I'm not young. I'm thirty-five,
and besides, this is my business. I've
been looking at death for eleven
years. I'm immune."</p>

<p>"I haven't your experience," she
admitted, "but I have your attitude."</p>

<p>"What's your name?" Kramer said.</p>

<p>"Barton, Mary Barton."</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m. Well, Mary&mdash;I can't
turn you down. I need you. But I
could wish you had taken some other
job."</p>

<p>"I'll survive."</p>

<p>He looked at her with faint admiration
in his greenish eyes. "Perhaps
you will," he said. "All right.
As to your duties&mdash;you will be my
assistant, which means you'll be a
dishwasher, laboratory technician,
secretary, junior pathologist, and
coffee maker. I'll help you with all
the jobs except the last one. I make
lousy coffee." Kramer grinned, his
teeth a white flash across the darkness
of his face. "You'll be on call
twenty-four hours a day, underpaid,
overworked, and in constant danger
until we lick Thurston's virus. You'll
be expected to handle the jobs of
three people unless I can get more
help&mdash;and I doubt that I can. People
stay away from here in droves.
There's no future in it."</p>

<p>Mary smiled wryly. "Literally or
figuratively?" she asked.</p>

<p>He chuckled. "You have a nice
sense of graveyard humor," he said.
"It'll help. But don't get careless. Assistants
are hard to find."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I won't.
While I'm not afraid of dying I don't
want to do it. And I have no illusions
about the danger. I was briefed
quite thoroughly."</p>

<p>"They wanted you to work upstairs?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">"I suppose they need help, too.
Thurston's Disease has riddled the
medical profession. Just don't forget
that this place can be a death trap.
One mistake and you've had it. Naturally,
we take every precaution, but
with a virus no protection is absolute.
If you're careless and make errors
in procedure, sooner or later one
of those submicroscopic protein molecules
will get into your system."</p>

<p>"You're still alive."</p>

<p>"So I am," Kramer said, "but I
don't take chances. My predecessor,
my secretary, my lab technician, my
junior pathologist, and my dishwasher
all died of Thurston's Disease." He
eyed her grimly. "Still want the job?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I lost a husband and a three-year
old son," Mary said with equal grimness.
"That's why I'm here. I want to
destroy the thing that killed my family.
I want to do something. I want
to be useful."</p>

<p>He nodded. "I think you can be,"
he said quietly.</p>

<p>"Mind if I smoke?" she asked. "I
need some defense against that pipe
of yours."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;go ahead. Out here it's all
right, but not in the security section."</p>

<p>Mary took a package of cigarettes
from her pocket, lit one and blew
a cloud of gray smoke to mingle with
the blue haze from Kramer's pipe.</p>

<p>"Comfortable?" Kramer asked.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>He looked at his wrist watch. "We
have half an hour before the roll tube
cultures are ready for examination.
That should be enough to tell you
about the modern Pasteur and his
mutant virus. Since your duties will
primarily involve Thurston's Disease,
you'd better know something about
it." He settled himself more comfortably
across the lab bench and
went on talking in a dry schoolmasterish
voice. "Alan Thurston was an
immunologist at Midwestern University
Medical School. Like most men
in the teaching trade, he also had a
research project. If it worked out,
he'd be one of the great names in
medicine; like Jenner, Pasteur, and
Salk. The result was that he pushed
it and wasn't too careful. He wanted
to be famous."</p>

<p>"He's well known now," Mary said,
"at least within the profession."</p>

<p>"Quite," Kramer said dryly. "He
was working with gamma radiations
on microorganisms, trying to produce
a mutated strain of <i>Micrococcus
pyogenes</i> that would have enhanced
antigenic properties."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, doctor. It's been
four years since I was active in nursing.
Translation, please."</p>

<p>Kramer chuckled. "He was trying
to make a vaccine out of a common
infectious organism. You may know
it better as <i>Staphylococcus</i>. As you
know, it's a pus former that's made
hospital life more dangerous than it
should be because it develops resistance
to antibiotics. What Thurston
wanted to do was to produce a strain
that would stimulate resistance in the
patient without causing disease&mdash;something
that would help patients
protect themselves rather than rely
upon doubtfully effective antibiotics."</p>

<p>"That wasn't a bad idea."</p>

<p>"There was nothing wrong with it.
The only trouble was that he wound
up with something else entirely. He
was like the man who wanted to
make a plastic suitable for children's
toys and ended up with a new explosive.
You see, what Thurston didn't
realize was that his cultures were contaminated.
He'd secured them from
the University Clinic and had, so he
thought, isolated them. But somehow
he'd brought a virus along&mdash;probably
one of the orphan group or possibly
a phage."</p>

<p>"Orphan?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;one that was not a normal
inhabitant of human tissues. At any
rate there was a virus&mdash;and he mutated
it rather than the bacteria. Actually,
it was simple enough, relatively
speaking, since a virus is infinitely
simpler in structure than a
bacterium, and hence much easier to
modify with ionizing radiation. So he
didn't produce an antigen&mdash;he produced
a disease instead. Naturally, he
contracted it, and during the period
between his infection and death he
managed to infect the entire hospital.
Before anyone realized what they
were dealing with, the disease
jumped from the hospital to the college,
and from the college to the
city, and from the city to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that part of it. It's
all over the world now&mdash;killing people
by the millions."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">"Well," Kramer said, "at least it's
solved the population explosion." He
blew a cloud of blue smoke in Mary's
direction. "And it did make Thurston
famous. His name won't be quickly
forgotten."</p>

<p>She coughed. "I doubt if it ever
will be," she said, "but it won't be remembered
the way he intended."</p>

<p>He looked at her suspiciously.
"That cough&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, it's not Thurston's Disease.
It's that pipe. It's rancid."</p>

<p>"It helps me think," Kramer said.</p>

<p>"You could try cigarettes&mdash;or
candy," she suggested.</p>

<p>"I'd rather smoke a pipe."</p>

<p>"There's cancer of the lip and
tongue," she said helpfully.</p>

<p>"Don't quote Ochsner. I don't
agree with him. And besides, you
smoke cigarettes, which are infinitely
worse."</p>

<p>"Only four or five a day. I don't
saturate my system with nicotine."</p>

<p>"In another generation," Kramer
observed, "you'd have run through
the streets of the city brandishing an
ax smashing saloons. You're a lineal
descendent of Carrie Nation." He
puffed quietly until his head was surrounded
by a nimbus of smoke. "Stop
trying to reform me," he added.
"You haven't been here long
enough."</p>

<p>"Not even God could do that, according
to the reports I've heard,"
she said.</p>

<p>He laughed. "I suppose my reputation
gets around."</p>

<p>"It does. You're an opinionated
slave driver, a bully, an intellectual
tyrant, and the best pathologist in
this center."</p>

<p>"The last part of that sentence
makes up for unflattering honesty of
the first," Kramer said. "At any rate,
once we realized the situation we
went to work to correct it. Institutes
like this were established everywhere
the disease appeared for the sole purpose
of examining, treating, and experimenting
with the hope of finding
a cure. This section exists for the
evaluation of treatment. We check
the human cases, and the primates in
the experimental laboratories. It is
our duty to find out if anything the
boys upstairs try shows any promise.
We were a pretty big section once,
but Thurston's virus has whittled us
down. Right now there is just you
and me. But there's still enough
work to keep us busy. The experiments
are still going on, and there
are still human cases, even though
the virus has killed off most of the
susceptibles. We've evaluated over a
thousand different drugs and treatments
in this Institute alone."</p>

<p>"And none of them have worked?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but that doesn't mean the
work's been useless. The research has
saved others thousands of man hours
chasing false leads. In this business
negative results are almost as important
as positive ones. We may never
discover the solution, but our work
will keep others from making the
same mistakes."</p>

<p>"I never thought of it that way."</p>

<p>"People seldom do. But if you
realize that this is international, that
every worker on Thurston's Disease
has a niche to fill, the picture will be
clearer. We're doing our part inside
the plan. Others are, too. And there
are thousands of labs involved. Somewhere,
someone will find the answer.
It probably won't be us, but we'll
help get the problem solved as quickly
as possible. That's the important
thing. It's the biggest challenge the
race has ever faced&mdash;and the most
important. It's a question of survival."
Kramer's voice was sober.
"We have to solve this. If Thurston's
Disease isn't checked, the human
race will become extinct. As a result,
for the first time in history all mankind
is working together."</p>

<p>"All? You mean the Communists
are, too?"</p>

<p>"Of course. What's an ideology if
there are no people to follow it?"
Kramer knocked the ashes out of his
pipe, looked at the laboratory clock
and shrugged. "Ten minutes more,"
he said, "and these tubes will be
ready. Keep an eye on that clock
and let me know. Meantime you can
straighten up this lab and find out
where things are. I'll be in the office
checking the progress reports." He
turned abruptly away, leaving her
standing in the middle of the cluttered
laboratory.</p>

<p>"Now what am I supposed to do
here?" Mary wondered aloud. "Clean
up, he says. Find out where things
are, he says. Get acquainted with
the place, he says. I could spend a
month doing that." She looked at
the littered bench, the wall cabinets
with sliding doors half open, the jars
of reagents sitting on the sink, the
drainboard, on top of the refrigerator
and on the floor. The disorder
was appalling. "How he ever manages
to work in here is beyond me.
I suppose that I'd better start somewhere&mdash;perhaps
I can get these bottles
in some sort of order first." She
sighed and moved toward the wall
cabinets. "Oh well," she mused, "I
asked for this."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">"Didn't you hear that buzzer?"
Kramer asked.</p>

<p>"Was that for me?" Mary said,
looking up from a pile of bottles and
glassware she was sorting.</p>

<p>"Partly. It means they've sent us
another post-mortem from upstairs."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;man or monkey, it
makes no difference. Whatever it is,
it's Thurston's Disease. Come along.
You might as well see what goes on
in our ultra modern necropsy suite."</p>

<p>"I'd like to." She put down the bottle
she was holding and followed
him to a green door at the rear of
the laboratory.</p>

<p>"Inside," Kramer said, "you will
find a small anteroom, a shower, and
a dressing room. Strip, shower, and
put on a clean set of lab coveralls and
slippers which you will find in the
dressing room. You'll find surgical
masks in the wall cabinet beside
the lockers. Go through the door beyond
the dressing room and wait for
me there. I'll give you ten minutes."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">"We do this both ways," Kramer
said as he joined her in the narrow
hall beyond the dressing room. "We'll
reverse the process going out."</p>

<p>"You certainly carry security to a
maximum," she said through the
mask that covered the lower part of
her face.</p>

<p>"You haven't seen anything yet,"
he said as he opened a door in the
hall. "Note the positive air pressure,"
he said. "Theoretically nothing can
get in here except what we bring
with us. And we try not to bring
anything." He stood aside to show her
the glassed-in cubicle overhanging a
bare room dominated by a polished
steel post-mortem table that glittered
in the harsh fluorescent lighting.
Above the table a number of jointed
rods and clamps hung from the ceiling.
A low metal door and series of
racks containing instruments and
glassware were set into the opposite
wall together with the gaping circular
orifice of an open autoclave.</p>

<p>"We work by remote control, just
like they do at the AEC. See those
handlers?" He pointed to the control
console set into a small stainless steel
table standing beside the sheet of
glass at the far end of the cubicle.
"They're connected to those gadgets
up there." He indicated the jointed
arms hanging over the autopsy table
in the room beyond. "I could perform
a major operation from here
and never touch the patient. Using
these I can do anything I could in
person with the difference that there's
a quarter inch of glass between me
and my work. I have controls that
let me use magnifiers, and even do
microdissection, if necessary."</p>

<p>"Where's the cadaver?" Mary
asked.</p>

<p>"Across the room, behind that
door," he said, waving at the low,
sliding metal partition behind the table.
"It's been prepped, decontaminated
and ready to go."</p>

<p>"What happens when you're
through?"</p>

<p>"Watch." Dr. Kramer pressed a
button on the console in front of him.
A section of flooring slid aside and
the table tipped. "The cadaver slides
off that table and through that hole.
Down below is a highly efficient crematorium."</p>

<p>Mary shivered. "Neat and effective,"
she said shakily.</p>

<p>"After that the whole room is
sprayed with germicide and sterilized
with live steam. The instruments go
into the autoclave, and thirty minutes
later we're ready for another post-mortem."</p>

<p>"We use the handlers to put specimens
into those jars," he said, pointing
to a row of capped glass jars of
assorted sizes on a wall rack behind
the table. "After they're capped, the
jars go onto that carrier beside the
table. From here they pass through
a decontamination chamber and into
the remote-control laboratory across
the hall where we can run biochemical
and histological techniques. Finished
slides and mounted specimens
then go through another decontamination
process to the outside lab.
Theoretically, this place is proof
against anything."</p>

<p>"It seems to be," Mary said, obviously
impressed. "I've never seen
anything so elegant."</p>

<p>"Neither did I until Thurston's Disease
became a problem." Kramer
shrugged and sat down behind the
controls. "Watch, now," he said as
he pressed a button. "Let's see what's
on deck&mdash;man or monkey. Want to
make a bet? I'll give you two to one
it's a monkey."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">The low door slid aside and a steel
carriage emerged into the necropsy
room bearing the nude body of a
man. The corpse gleamed pallidly under
the harsh shadowless glare of the
fluorescents in the ceiling as Kramer,
using the handlers, rolled it onto the
post-mortem table and clamped it in
place on its back. He pushed another
button and the carriage moved back
into the wall and the steel door slid
shut. "That'll be decontaminated," he
said, "and sent back upstairs for
another body. I'd have lost," he remarked
idly. "Lately the posts have
been running three to one in favor of
monkeys."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/002.png" width="555" height="550" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>He moved a handler and picked
up a heavy scalpel from the instrument
rack. "There's a certain advantage
to this," he said as he moved
the handler delicately. "These gadgets
give a tremendous mechanical
advantage. I can cut right through
small bones and cartilage without
using a saw."</p>

<p>"How nice," Mary said. "I expect
you enjoy yourself."</p>

<p>"I couldn't ask for better equipment,"
he replied noncommittally.
With deft motion of the handler he
drew the scalpel down across the
chest and along the costal margins
in the classic inverted "Y" incision.
"We'll take a look at the thorax first,"
he said, as he used the handlers to
pry open the rib cage and expose the
thoracic viscera. "Ah! Thought so!
See that?" He pointed with a small
handler that carried a probe. "Look
at those lungs." He swung a viewer
into place so Mary could see better.
"Look at those abscesses and necrosis.
It's Thurston's Disease, all right,
with secondary bacterial invasion."</p>

<p>The grayish solidified masses of
tissue looked nothing like the normal
pink appearance of healthy lungs.
Studded with yellowish spherical abscesses
they lay swollen and engorged
within the gaping cavity of the chest.</p>

<p>"You know the pathogenesis of
Thurston's Disease?" Kramer asked.</p>

<p>Mary shook her head, her face
yellowish-white in the glare of the
fluorescents.</p>

<p>"It begins with a bronchial cough,"
Kramer said. "The virus attacks the
bronchioles first, destroys them, and
passes into the deeper tissues of the
lungs. As with most virus diseases
there is a transitory leukopenia&mdash;a
drop in the total number of white
blood cells&mdash;and a rise in temperature
of about two or three degrees.
As the virus attacks the alveolar
structures, the temperature rises and
the white blood cell count becomes
elevated. The lungs become inflamed
and painful. There is a considerable
quantity of lymphoid exudate and
pleural effusion. Secondary invaders
and pus-forming bacteria follow the
viral destruction of the lung tissue
and form abscesses. Breathing becomes
progressively more difficult as
more lung tissue is destroyed. Hepatization
and necrosis inactivate more
lung tissue as the bacteria get in their
dirty work, and finally the patient
suffocates."</p>

<p>"But what if the bacteria are controlled
by antibiotics?"</p>

<p>"Then the virus does the job. It
produces atelectasis followed by progressive
necrosis of lung tissue with
gradual liquefaction of the parenchyma.
It's slower, but just as fatal. This
fellow was lucky. He apparently
stayed out of here until he was almost
dead. Probably he's had the
disease for about a week. If he'd
have come in early, we could have
kept him alive for maybe a month.
The end, however, would have been
the same."</p>

<p>"It's a terrible thing," Mary said
faintly.</p>

<p>"You'll get used to it. We get one
or two every day." He shrugged.
"There's nothing here that's interesting,"
he said as he released the
clamps and tilted the table. For what
seemed to Mary an interminable
time, the cadaver clung to the polished
steel. Then abruptly it slid off
the shining surface and disappeared
through the square hole in the floor.
"We'll clean up now," Kramer said
as he placed the instruments in the
autoclave, closed the door and
locked it, and pressed three buttons
on the console.</p>

<p>From jets embedded in the walls
a fine spray filled the room with fog.</p>

<p>"Germicide," Kramer said. "Later
there'll be steam. That's all for now.
Do you want to go?"</p>

<p>Mary nodded.</p>

<p>"If you feel a little rocky there's
a bottle of Scotch in my desk. I'll
split a drink with you when we get
out of here."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Mary said. "I think I
could use one."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">"Barton! Where is the MacNeal
stain!" Kramer's voice came from the
lab. "I left it on the sink and it's
gone!"</p>

<p>"It's with the other blood stains
and reagents. Second drawer from
the right in the big cabinet. There's
a label on the drawer," Mary called
from the office. "If you can wait until
I finish filing these papers, I'll come
in and help you."</p>

<p>"I wish you would," Kramer's
voice was faintly exasperated. "Ever
since you've organized my lab I
can't find anything."</p>

<p>"You just have a disorderly mind,"
Mary said, as she slipped the last
paper into its proper folder and
closed the file. "I'll be with you in a
minute."</p>

<p>"I don't dare lose you," Kramer
said as Mary came into the lab.
"You've made yourself indispensable.
It'd take me six months to undo what
you've done in one. Not that I mind,"
he amended, "but I was used to
things the way they were." He looked
around the orderly laboratory with a
mixture of pride and annoyance.
"Things are so neat they're almost
painful."</p>

<p>"You look more like a pathologist
should," Mary said as she deftly removed
the tray of blood slides from
in front of him and began to run the
stains. "It's my job to keep you free
to think."</p>

<p>"Whose brilliant idea is that?
Yours?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;the Director's. He told me
what my duties were when I came
here. And I think he's right. You
should be using your brain rather
than fooling around with blood stains
and sectioning tissues."</p>

<p>"But I like to do things like that,"
Kramer protested. "It's relaxing."</p>

<p>"What right have you to relax,"
Mary said. "Outside, people are dying
by the thousands and you want
to relax. Have you looked at the
latest mortality reports?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You should. The WHO estimates
that nearly two billion people have
died since Thurston's Disease first appeared
in epidemic proportions.
That's two out of three. And more
are dying every day. Yet you want
to relax."</p>

<p>"I know," Kramer said, "but what
can we do about it. We're working
but we're getting no results."</p>

<p>"You might use that brain of
yours," Mary said bitterly. "You're
supposed to be a scientist. You have
facts. Can't you put them together?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." He shrugged,
"I've been working on this problem
longer than you think. I come down
here at night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know. I clean up after you."</p>

<p>"I haven't gotten anywhere. Sure,
we can isolate the virus. It grows
nicely on monkey lung cells. But
that doesn't help. The thing has no
apparent antigenicity. It parasitizes,
but it doesn't trigger any immune reaction.
We can kill it, but the
strength of the germicide is too great
for living tissue to tolerate."</p>

<p>"Some people seem to be immune."</p>

<p>"Sure they do&mdash;but why?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me. I'm not the scientist."</p>

<p>"Play like one," Kramer growled.
"Here are the facts. The disease attacks
people of all races and ages. So
far every one who is attacked dies.
Adult Europeans and Americans appear
to be somewhat more resistant
than others on a population basis.
Somewhere around sixty per cent of
them are still alive, but it's wiped out
better than eighty per cent of some
groups. Children get it worse. Right
now I doubt if one per cent of the
children born during the past ten
years are still alive."</p>

<p>"It's awful!" Mary said.</p>

<p>"It's worse than that. It's extinction.
Without kids the race will die out."
Kramer rubbed his forehead.</p>

<p>"Have you any ideas?"</p>

<p>"Children have less resistance,"
Kramer replied. "An adult gets exposed
to a number of diseases to
which he builds an immunity. Possibly
one of these has a cross immunity
against Thurston's virus."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you work on that
line?" Mary asked.</p>

<p>"Just what do you think I've been
doing? That idea was put out months
ago, and everyone has been taking a
crack at it. There are twenty-four
laboratories working full time on that
facet and God knows how many more
working part time like we are. I've
screened a dozen common diseases,
including the six varieties of the
common cold virus. All, incidentally,
were negative."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;are you going to keep on
with it?"</p>

<p>"I have to." Kramer rubbed his
eyes. "It won't let me sleep. I'm sure
we're on the right track. Something
an adult gets gives him resistance or
immunity." He shrugged. "Tell you
what. You run those bloods out and
I'll go take another look at the data."
He reached into his lab coat and produced
a pipe. "I'll give it another
try."</p>

<p>"Sometimes I wish you'd read without
puffing on that thing," Mary said.</p>

<p>"Your delicate nose will be the
death of me yet&mdash;" Kramer said.</p>

<p>"It's my lungs I'm worried about,"
Mary said. "They'll probably look like
two pieces of well-tanned leather if I
associate with you for another year."</p>

<p>"Stop complaining. You've gotten
me to wear clean lab coats. Be satisfied
with a limited victory," Kramer
said absently, his eyes staring unseeingly
at a row of reagent bottles on
the bench. Abruptly he nodded. "Fantastic,"
he muttered, "but it's worth a
check." He left the room, slamming
the door behind him in his hurry.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">"That man!" Mary murmured. "He'd
drive a saint out of his mind. If I
wasn't so fond of him I'd quit. If
anyone told me I'd fall in love with a
pathologist, I'd have said they were
crazy. I wish&mdash;" Whatever the wish
was, it wasn't uttered. Mary gasped
and coughed rackingly. Carefully she
moved back from the bench, opened
a drawer and found a thermometer.
She put it in her mouth. Then she
drew a drop of blood from her forefinger
and filled a red and white cell
pipette, and made a smear of the remainder.</p>

<p>She was interrupted by another
spasm of coughing, but she waited
until the paroxysm passed and went
methodically back to her self-appointed
task. She had done this many times
before. It was routine procedure to
check on anything that might be
Thurston's Disease. A cold, a sore
throat, a slight difficulty in breathing&mdash;all
demanded the diagnostic check.
It was as much a habit as breathing.
This was probably the result of that
cold she'd gotten last week, but there
was nothing like being sure. Now let's
see&mdash;temperature 99.5 degrees, red
cell count 4&frac12; million. White cell
count ... oh! 2500 ... leukopenia!
The differential showed a virtual
absence of polymorphs, lymphocytes
and monocytes. The whole slide
didn't have two hundred. Eosinophils
and basophils way up&mdash;twenty and
fifteen per cent respectively&mdash;a relative
rise rather than an absolute one&mdash;leukopenia,
no doubt about it.</p>

<p>She shrugged. There wasn't much
question. She had Thurston's Disease.
It was the beginning stages, the harsh
cough, the slight temperature, the
leukopenia. Pretty soon her white cell
count would begin to rise, but it
would rise too late. In fact, it was already
too late. It's funny, she thought.
I'm going to die, but it doesn't frighten
me. In fact, the only thing that
bothers me is that poor Walter is going
to have a terrible time finding
things. But I can't put this place the
way it was. I couldn't hope to.</p>

<p>She shook her head, slid gingerly
off the lab stool and went to the hall
door. She'd better check in at the
clinic, she thought. There was bed
space in the hospital now. Plenty of it.
That hadn't been true a few months
ago but the only ones who were dying
now were the newborn and an occasional
adult like herself. The epidemic
had died out not because of lack of
virulence but because of lack of victims.
The city outside, one of the first
affected, now had less than forty per
cent of its people left alive. It was a
hollow shell of its former self. People
walked its streets and went through
the motions of life. But they were
not really alive. The vital criteria
were as necessary for a race as for an
individual. Growth, reproduction, irritability,
metabolism&mdash;Mary smiled
wryly. Whoever had authored that
hackneyed mnemonic that life was a
"grim" proposition never knew how
right he was, particularly when one of
the criteria was missing.</p>

<p>The race couldn't reproduce. That
was the true horror of Thurston's Disease&mdash;not
how it killed, but who it
killed. No children played in the
parks and playgrounds. The schools
were empty. No babies were pushed
in carriages or taken on tours through
the supermarkets in shopping carts.
No advertisements of motherhood, or
children, or children's things were in
the newspapers or magazines. They
were forbidden subjects&mdash;too dangerously
emotional to touch. Laughter
and shrill young voices had vanished
from the earth to be replaced by the
drab grayness of silence and waiting.
Death had laid cold hands upon the
hearts of mankind and the survivors
were frozen to numbness.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">It was odd, she thought, how wrong
the prophets were. When Thurston's
Disease broke into the news there
were frightened predictions of the
end of civilization. But they had not
materialized. There were no mass insurrections,
no rioting, no organized
violence. Individual excesses, yes&mdash;but
nothing of a group nature. What
little panic there was at the beginning
disappeared once people realized
that there was no place to go.
And a grim passivity had settled upon
the survivors. Civilization did not
break down. It endured. The mechanics
remained intact. People had
to do something even if it was only
routine counterfeit of normal life&mdash;the
stiff upper lip in the face of disaster.</p>

<p>It would have been far more odd,
Mary decided, if mankind had given
way to panic. Humanity had survived
other plagues nearly as terrible as
this&mdash;and racial memory is long. The
same grim patience of the past was
here in the present. Man would somehow
survive, and civilization go on.</p>

<p>It was inconceivable that mankind
would become extinct. The whole
vast resources and pooled intelligence
of surviving humanity were focused
upon Thurston's Disease. And the
disease would yield. Humanity waited
with childlike confidence for the
miracle that would save it. And the
miracle would happen, Mary knew it
with a calm certainty as she stood in
the cross corridor at the end of the
hall, looking down the thirty yards of
tile that separated her from the elevator
that would carry her up to the
clinic and oblivion. It might be too
late for her, but not for the race. Nature
had tried unaided to destroy man
before&mdash;and had failed. And her unholy
alliance with man's genius would
also fail.</p>

<p>She wondered as she walked down
the corridor if the others who had
sickened and died felt as she did. She
speculated with grim amusement
whether Walter Kramer would be as
impersonal as he was with the others,
when he performed the post-mortem
on her body. She shivered at the
thought of that bare sterile room and
the shining table. Death was not a
pretty thing. But she could meet it
with resignation if not with courage.
She had already seen too much for it
to have any meaning. She did not falter
as she placed a finger on the elevator
button.</p>

<p>Poor Walter&mdash;she sighed. Sometimes
it was harder to be among the
living. It was good that she didn't let
him know how she felt. She had
sensed a change in him recently. His
friendly impersonality had become
merely friendly. It could, with a little
encouragement, have developed into
something else. But it wouldn't now.
She sighed again. His hardness had
been a tower of strength. And his bitter
gallows humor had furnished a
wry relief to grim reality. It had been
nice to work with him. She wondered
if he would miss her. Her lips
curled in a faint smile. He would,
if only for the trouble he would have
in making chaos out of the order she
had created. Why couldn't that elevator
hurry?</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">"Mary! Where are you going?"
Kramer's voice was in her ears, and
his hand was on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Don't touch me!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" His voice was curiously
different. Younger, excited.</p>

<p>"I have Thurston's Disease," she
said.</p>

<p>He didn't let go. "Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"The presumptive tests were positive."</p>

<p>"Initial stages?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "I had the first coughing
attack a few minutes ago."</p>

<p>He pulled her away from the elevator
door that suddenly slid open.
"You were going to that death trap
upstairs," he said.</p>

<p>"Where else can I go?"</p>

<p>"With me," he said. "I think I can
help you."</p>

<p>"How? Have you found a cure for
the virus?"</p>

<p>"I think so. At least it's a better
possibility than the things they're using
up there." His voice was urgent.
"And to think I might never have
seen it if you hadn't put me on the
track."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you're right?"</p>

<p>"Not absolutely, but the facts fit.
The theory's good."</p>

<p>"Then I'm going to the clinic. I
can't risk infecting you. I'm a carrier
now. I can kill you, and you're too important
to die."</p>

<p>"You don't know how wrong you
are," Kramer said.</p>

<p>"Let go of me!"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;you're coming back!"</p>

<p>She twisted in his grasp. "Let me
go!" she sobbed and broke into a
fit of coughing worse than before.</p>

<p>"What I was trying to say," Dr.
Kramer said into the silence that followed,
"is that if you have Thurston's
Disease, you've been a carrier for at
least two weeks. If I am going to get
it, your going away can't help. And if
I'm not, I'm not."</p>

<p>"Do you come willingly or shall I
knock you unconscious and drag you
back?" Kramer asked.</p>

<p>She looked at his face. It was grimmer
than she had ever seen it before.
Numbly she let him lead her back to
the laboratory.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">"But, Walter&mdash;I can't. That's sixty in
the past ten hours!" she protested.</p>

<p>"Take it," he said grimly, "then take
another. And inhale. Deeply."</p>

<p>"But they make me dizzy."</p>

<p>"Better dizzy than dead. And, by
the way&mdash;how's your chest?"</p>

<p>"Better. There's no pain now. But
the cough is worse."</p>

<p>"It should be."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You've never smoked enough to
get a cigarette cough," he said.</p>

<p>She shook her head dizzily. "You're
so right," she said.</p>

<p>"And that's what nearly killed you,"
he finished triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"I'm certain. Naturally, I can't
prove it&mdash;yet. But that's just a matter
of time. Your response just about
clinches it. Take a look at the records.
Who gets this disease? Youngsters&mdash;with
nearly one hundred per
cent morbidity and one hundred per
cent mortality. Adults&mdash;less than fifty
per cent morbidity&mdash;and again one
hundred per cent mortality. What
makes the other fifty per cent immune?
Your crack about leather
lungs started me thinking&mdash;so I fed
the data cards into the computer and
keyed them for smoking versus incidence.
And I found that not one
heavy smoker had died of Thurston's
Disease. Light smokers and nonsmokers&mdash;plenty
of them&mdash;but not one
single nicotine addict. And there
were over ten thousand randomized
cards in that spot check. And there's
the exact reverse of that classic experiment
the lung cancer boys used
to sell their case. Among certain religious
groups which prohibit smoking
there was nearly one hundred per cent
mortality of all ages!</p>

<p>"And so I thought since the disease
was just starting in you, perhaps I
could stop it if I loaded you with
tobacco smoke. And it works!"</p>

<p>"You're not certain yet," Mary said.
"I might not have had the disease."</p>

<p>"You had the symptoms. And
there's virus in your sputum."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, nothing! I've passed the word&mdash;and
the boys in the other labs figure
that there's merit in it. We're going to
call it Barton's Therapy in your honor.
It's going to cause a minor social
revolution. A lot of laws are going to
have to be rewritten. I can see where
it's going to be illegal for children
not to smoke. Funny, isn't it?</p>

<p>"I've contacted the maternity ward.
They have three babies still alive upstairs.
We get all the newborn in this
town, or didn't you know. Funny,
isn't it, how we still try to reproduce.
They're rigging a smoke chamber for
the kids. The head nurse is screaming
like a wounded tiger, but she'll
feel better with live babies to care for.
The only bad thing I can see is that it
may cut down on her chain smoking.
She's been worried a lot about infant
mortality.</p>

<p>"And speaking of nurseries&mdash;that
reminds me. I wanted to ask you
something."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Will you marry me? I've wanted
to ask you before, but I didn't dare.
Now I think you owe me something&mdash;your
life. And I'd like to take care
of it from now on."</p>

<p>"Of course I will," Mary said. "And
I have reasons, too. If I marry you, you
can't possibly do that silly thing you
plan."</p>

<p>"What thing?"</p>

<p>"Naming the treatment Barton's.
It'll have to be Kramer's." &#9632;</p>
